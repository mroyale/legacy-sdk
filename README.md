# Mario Royale Legacy SDK
Legacy Team will publish an open-source version of *Mario Royale Legacy* shortly after the release of version 7.0.<br>
The SDK will strip sensitive components such as internal developer tools, maps and other original assets.<br>
These may be replaced with stubs or dummy data where appropriate.<br>
The SDK will be periodically synced with updates from the live game.<br>

## Usage
Anyone can fork, build upon, share and distribute this SDK.<br>
Contributions made to the SDK may be merged into the live game.

## Contribution
By contributing to the SDK, you grant Legacy Team the irrevocable right to use, modify and distribute your code as part of the project.<br>
**Contributions cannot be revoked once merged.**<br>
All accepted contributors will be credited in the live game.
